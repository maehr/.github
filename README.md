I am Junior Fellow of the [IFN](https://www.ifn.unibe.ch/) at the [WBKolleg](https://www.wbkolleg.unibe.ch/) at the University of Bern and digital project manager at [Stadt.Geschichte.Basel](https://www.stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/) at University of Basel.
I studied history and philosophy of knowledge, computer science, and banking & finance in Zurich and Berlin.
From 2018 to 2022, I was a research assistant at the [Chair of the History of Technology at ETH Zurich](https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.tg.ethz.ch/personen/details/moritz-maehr/) and wrote a dissertation on the [digitization of migration authorities in Switzerland in the 1960s](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000587758).
The study was part of the SNSF-funded project [Trading Zones](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188795).
My research interests include science & technology studies, digital humanities, and history of computing.
I am an advocate of open science, open access, and open source.
